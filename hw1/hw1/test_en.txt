my only issue with this quote and with some of the other awesome quotes from bernie is that he could be just a touch more suave. and i say that, not as a criticism for my tastes but i worry about the general electorate when it comes to that time. if he had just capped that sentence with "nobody's gonna tell me what to do...except the american people", i think it would be drive home the feel good vibes for people who are still on the fence for him or who don't know him. he did a great interview with tom ashbrook on "on point" this past week and the follow up discussion is excellent about where bernie needs to shore up his weaknesses and his "gruff tone" , in my view, is one of them. not for me, i dig it, but for people who need to be coddled by their politicians or who need to get his all important messages with a little sugar on top.
